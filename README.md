# Asteroid Classification Using AI Models 🚀  

Asteroid classification is crucial as some may pose a threat to life on Earth. This research focuses on identifying near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) as hazardous or non-hazardous using advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) models.  

## 🧠 AI Models Explored  
We leveraged and compared various state-of-the-art AI techniques, including:  
- **Self-Attention and Intersample Attention Transformer (SAINT)**  
- **Graph Sample and Aggregate (GraphSAGE)**  
- **Tabular Neural Networks (TabNet)**  
- **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**  
- **Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)**  
- **Simple Contrastive Learning Representation (SIMCLR)**  

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset, sourced from **NASA**, consists of **4,000+ asteroid samples** with key features such as:  
- **Magnitude**  
- **Perihelion Distance** (the closest point in an asteroid’s orbit to the Sun)  

## 🏆 Key Findings  
After extensive experimentation, **GraphSAGE** achieved the **highest accuracy**, making it the most effective model for early detection of Earth-hazardous asteroids. These findings contribute to a **better understanding of asteroid attributes** and can assist astronomers in planetary defense efforts.  

## 🔍 Impact  
This study helps in:  
✅ Enhancing asteroid classification for risk assessment  
✅ Improving early detection of potentially hazardous asteroids  
✅ Supporting astronomers in understanding asteroid behavior
